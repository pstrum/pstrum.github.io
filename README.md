# Aloha ü§ôüèº

I'm a Staff Software Engineer and technical leader with over a decade of experience building and scaling large-scale software solutions. I'm adept at leading cross-functional teams, architecting end-to-end systems, and mentoring engineers to achieve business-critical outcomes.

My career has been dedicated to dancing across the full stack, with expertise in a wide range of technologies, including Node.js, Typescript, React Native, and AWS. I have a proven track record of successfully leading projects that have transitioned products to new business models and generated millions of dollars in revenue. My background in music has also honed a unique blend of creative and analytical problem-solving.
