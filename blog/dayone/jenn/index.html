    <section class="post">
       <p>Hello to our dear daughter, sister and friend, Jennifer,</p>
<p>We have come together as a family for <strong>our concern for you</strong>.  We would really would prefer to do this in person, e-mail is the next best option, Skype a little awkward.</p>
<p>We have been so concerned and distressed that we sat down to talk to a counselor to give us some guidance on how to address our feelings and concerns.</p>
<p><em>You don't know how to tell Jennifer how you feel, which is concerned.</em></p>
<p>We have observed lately how <strong>uncomfortable we are</strong> with your <strong>irrational fears</strong> about <strong>everyday things</strong>, your reactivity and irritability about <strong>simple conversations</strong> in social situations.  We feel we are <strong>walking on eggshells</strong> around our conversations and social situations <strong>in case of your reaction</strong> to what we may be saying.</p>
<p><em>My first reaction is that people can't be afraid of other's reactions. They have to speak their thoughts. Walking on eggshells gets people nowhere and a counselor isn't much better.</em></p>
<p><em>You express "concern" for Jennifer, but the overarching problem written is that you are uncomfortable with someone else's fears and irritability.</em></p>
<p>As your mother, I wanted to <strong>express my worry</strong> that <strong>you still exhibit signs of trichotillomania</strong> and your pronounced <strong>fear of thunder and lightening really concerns me</strong>.  I wanted to talk to you on our trip to Seattle but really was afraid of your reaction.  I was so hurt at times walking with you and Brie, your words and tone of voice, how Molly and I were poorly influencing Brie.  Actually crying at the time and later just thinking about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't go away unless it is treated. Recognizing that it is a disease is a good step for Debi.</li>
<li>We all have fears, what I suppose you mean is that you find the reaction uncomfortable. The pattern developing is that these are issues with you. If someone has a fear, you comfort them and not make them feel bad, like it is pathological.</li>
<li>You have to stand up for yourself. This is your daughter we are talking about. She's not trying to hurt you, she is discussing a point of interest or concern directly with you. If it is uncomfortable, you have to step back, listen, respond. Do not take offense and shut down or dismiss. Or cry, really. </li>
<li>Again, the theme is you feel hurt and uncomfortable, and want the reason to be something not said yet. Let's see...</li>
</ul>
<p>As your father, I remember your anger at me for putting a paper tab with a small staple remaining on it from a clean shirt in my trash basket. You were worried about the staple killing Brie if she ate it. My reactions were that you were right to worry about Brie eating stuff out of the trash and that I would happily put the basket up on the tub where Brie couldn’t get to it.  But I was taken aback by the intensity of your feeling toward me, as if I would carelessly kill Brie. Another example is your worried supervision of my driving: I know everybody’s driving has a multiplicity of decisions, corrections and little errors, but in your lifetime I have not had an accident while driving you. It’s not existentially hurtful but it makes me a little angry and nervous which isn’t good. I would like you to be more relaxed and confident, so I can be too.  Driving is statistically dangerous so it’s good to be alert. On the other hand, thunder and lightning are not statistically dangerous. If I could waive a loving magic wand, I’d send your pathological fear of them away so you could enjoy dramatic weather.</p>
<ul>
<li>Side not: WTF is up with all the "As your ____"? Just speak. </li>
<li>What are these examples of? </li>
<li>The probability of driving accidents is a direct relationship with hours on the road. Simply by being 73, you are high risk for accident. </li>
<li>Again, a lot of "it makes me feel bad" that you voiced an opinion. Here, there are a lot of "worries" that Jennifer is expressing. Why should she not express them?</li>
<li>Some people like snakes, some people like thunder, some people like thrilling driving...and you know what? Some people don't. A magic wand would suck in this case, because you would be changing a good person afraid of storm. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You're concerned about how you feel uncomfortable with Jennifer voicing fears, opinions, and concerns.</strong></p>
<p>As your brother, I come home and I feel a tension about what should and should not be said, or what jokes can or cannot be made.  Last year I told you not to talk to me with attitude over an exchange about how well done chicken needs to be cooked.  After that you escalated the situation, demanding that we talk.  In that situation, the outward irritability you displayed and words that you used really shocked me, hurt me, made me angry and concerned about your wellbeing.  From a distance, I come home and I see the way in which you speak and react to mom and dad- about things you might disagree or get annoyed with. Some are as simple as comments made whilst driving as a passenger in a car, and I feel deeply upset by it.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't say whatever you want. What you're saying is that you are afraid Jennifer will voice an opinion if you say <em>something</em>. You can't stop that. </li>
<li>Again, you feel upset because Jennifer has said something, and in particular, in a way that makes you concerned for her well being. That needs elaboration. </li>
</ul>
<p>As a family, there have been many situations <strong>over a sustained time where we have felt shocked at your words</strong>, <strong>hurt at your attitude to us</strong> and fearful of your stressful reactions. <strong>We have been individually too fearful of bringing this to your attention</strong> because of the anticipated reaction it might receive. You have accused us of being snarky when we addressed an issue with you and there have been times we have felt you have been <strong>disrespectful to us</strong>. We know that you love us and we love you so much- so much that we want to enjoy our all our moments with you knowing that you are having a genuinely good time around us.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you mean by shocked? It isn't clear.</li>
<li>What you brining to our attention is not concern for Jennifer, it is that you are uncomfortable with her around.</li>
<li>This whole thing is disrespectful to Jennifer and me. </li>
</ul>
<p>We ask some things of you- to help us as a family and to help you. Please do some reflecting on why you react to us this way.  We do not want to ignore this and just go on since you are so far away from us now.  For us, it is important to address these issues, even if it means seeing somebody.  We obviously feel very distressed about this and have concerns that behaviors could eventually negatively impact your health and relationship with others.  There are countless ways in which you bring joy to our lives, it is only this behavior and whatever it is rooted in that is our cause for concern.</p>
<p>We would like to talk to you about these issues and see if we can develop some resolution.  You are such a big, bright part of our lives and we love you terribly or we wouldn't have wanted to go this far to pursue this with a counselor.  We want you surrounded by our total love, admiration and respect we have for you and all the wonderful things you have achieved in your life.</p>
<p>Love<br />
Debi, David &amp; James</p>

<hr />
<p>I think you are taking everything too personally. It brings out a lot of issues that you probably haven't dealt with in a long time. You feel like Jennifer is attacking you and are afraid of her reactions. </p>
<p>At this point I would like to say that the combined some of all of you have spent less time than me with Jennifer the last third of her life. You say a lot of things about Jennifers personality that you want changed: less opinions, different tone of voice, no fears, no trich. People can change, but this whole thing comes off like "we don't want you being yourself, be quiet 🤐."</p>
<p>"We are concerned with why you react to us this way."</p>
<p>It overall sounds like a lot of denial. Many of the "issues" above really point out a lack of addressing real issues for a very long time. I think you should definitely continue counseling, maybe with a different counselor, and address that lack of communication between David and Deb, and David's weight, exercise, and physical problem (not to mention sleep apnea).</p>
